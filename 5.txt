WEB SCRAPPING using BEAUTIFULSOUP package in python(without using any web scrapping tool)
We start by opening the site that we want to scrap. 
1) copy the URL into a variable.
2) import "requests" in python , to use "get" method which issues HTTP GET request to a given URL.
3) page=requests.get(URL) 
   print(page.text)
   this command gives whole content of the given page .
4) It prints the whole content (html code) of given page.
5) we can use the javascript elements to grab or scrap only the selective cotents by mentioning the element ID.
6) we can use prettify method in beautifulsuop package to print only the content not along with html tags.
